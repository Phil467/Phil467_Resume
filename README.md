## PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY
Initially an engineer in geosciences, my taste for creative expression gradually guided me towards numerical methods and software development for over 10 years. I have become familiar with nearly 15 programming languages, in the fields of web and desktop development, data analysis, scientific computing and performance. I have developed numerous tools for various applications both in the workplace and during my university career, where I held key positions. Additionally, nurturing a strong interest in mathematical research, I have discovered several effective techniques for finding the roots of simple or complex equations. I have also practiced developing an arithmetic library for computing infinitely large numbers. I would like to leverage my skills in ambitious projects.
